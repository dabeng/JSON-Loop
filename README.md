How to get a parent node if I have gotten a child node reference in a JOSN object? JSONLoop will provide you with a child.parent() method.


##Classic Usage
Note: Here I don't provide API specification because the following code snippets are demonstractive enough.
####find a parent node based on a given node



####find sibling nodes based on a given node



####find ancestor nodes based on a given node



####find descendent nodes based on a given node



####find the nodes based on property value
